                            and Austria. These were then compared with
                            the measurements of these emotions as
                            recorded in standard social surveys of the
                            population. The two measures of emotion
                            (social-media-based and survey-based) tracked
                            each other extraordinarily well, although clear
                            differences between text analysis methods and
                            emotions exist. The Twitter measures of emotion

                            Nonetheless, it is becoming increasingly clear

                            to lower well-being. (The DMN is a large brain
